Ideas and/or goals

Browser JS
    More mobile friendly functionality:
        tap item to mark as done

    implement item text editing (long-press on mobile?)

Implement a backend
    serve up memo items stored in a DB as JSON files
    receive new memos created in browser and store in DB

Rewrite CSS/layout
    Post-it note inspired.
    Each memo item is a "card".
